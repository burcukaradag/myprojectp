    To use Aloe Vera on the skin, snap off a stalk and rub the liquid on the affected area. Make sure to speak to your doctor first, in case you have any allergies.
    
    How to care for aloe vera?
    Aloe Vera thrives in indirect sunlight, and the soil should be left to dry just slightly (1-2cm) before deeply watering. If the plant is turning brown, it’s a sign of either too many chemicals in the air (from cleaning, for example) or too much sunlight</p>
